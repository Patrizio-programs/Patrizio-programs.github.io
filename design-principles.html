          <p>This site shows great use of contrast all across the page. Using the main colors of Purple, Orange and White they contrast different icons, text and even buttons. 
            This gives the page an organized and vibrant look, while maintaining a professional look due to the perfect use and organization of the colors.</p>

        <section class="Hierarchy">
          <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>

          <p>This site uses great Visual Hierarchy by explicitly sizing the picture on the page. 
            It's size makes it the first thing you notice thus pointing your attention to view it. The second thing is the Title underneath the picture. 
          Though this screenshot doesn't show the full title it is obvious due to it's size and the font being bold and in all caps that it is connected with the picture.</p>

        <section class="Proximity">

          <h3>Proximity</h3>
          <br>
          <p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stackoverflow.com</a> </p>

          </picture>

          <p>The proximity in this website is very clear. The blue and orange boxes are seperated by some whitespace. 
            Even though the space is not alot the boxes help to group the like information together and sends a clear message. 
            Even the "Log in" and "Sign Up" buttons at the top right are grouped closely to send a message of relation between the two. </p>
